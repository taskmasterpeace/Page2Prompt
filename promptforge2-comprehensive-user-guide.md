## 1. Introduction

PromptForge is an AI-powered application designed to assist creative professionals in generating detailed visual prompts from scripts. It integrates various inputs such as script content, shot descriptions, director's notes, and style preferences to produce comprehensive and contextually rich prompts for visual content creation.

## 2. System Overview

PromptForge consists of several interconnected components:
- Core Logic (core.py)
- User Interface (ui.py)
- Script Analyzer (script_analyzer.py)
- Prompt Manager (prompt_manager.py)
- Meta Chain for prompt generation (meta_chain.py)
- Main execution file (main.py)

These components work together to process user inputs, analyze scripts, and generate tailored prompts.

## 3. File Structure

### 4.6 main.py

This is the entry point of the application.

Functions:
- main(): Initializes the application and starts the UI

## 5. Workflow and Data Flow

1. User inputs (style, shot description, director's notes, script) are collected through the UI.
2. The PromptForgeCore processes these inputs:
   - Style is set and a suffix is generated
   - Shot description is processed to update elements
   - Director's notes are processed to further update elements
   - Script is analyzed for context and entities
3. The MetaChain uses all this information to generate a prompt.
4. The generated prompt is displayed in the UI.
5. The user can save the prompt, which is then managed by the PromptManager.

## 6. User Interaction Guide

1. Launch the application by running main.py.
2. Input the desired style in the "Style" field.
3. Describe the shot in the "Shot Description" field.
4. Select a camera move from the dropdown menu.
5. Enter any director's notes in the "Director's Notes" field.
6. Paste your script in the "Script" field and highlight relevant sections.
7. Choose whether to stick to the script using the checkbox.
8. Select the desired prompt length.
9. Click "Generate Prompt" to create a prompt.
10. The generated prompt will appear in the "Generated Prompt" field.
11. You can save the prompt using the "Save Prompt" button.

## 7. Extending and Customizing PromptForge

- To add new elements, modify the ElementManager class in core.py.
- To change the prompt generation logic, modify the MetaChain class in meta_chain.py.
- To add new UI features, modify the PromptForgeUI class in ui.py.
- To enhance script analysis, modify the ScriptAnalyzer class in script_analyzer.py.
- To change how prompts are saved or loaded, modify the PromptManager class in prompt_manager.py.

Remember to maintain the existing method signatures when modifying classes to ensure compatibility with the rest of the system.
